            <p className="text-text-secondary font-body leading-relaxed mb-4">
              SheCareHub was born from a simple yet profound realization: modern wellness often overlooks the deep, nuanced needs of women. Our journey began not in a boardroom, but from personal stories and shared experiences of searching for solutions that were not only effective but also gentle, safe, and nurturing. We saw a need for a brand that listened before it created.
